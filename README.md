# Open Services Group: Community

Welcome to the Open Services Group community!

This is the starting point for joining and contributing to the Open Services Group community - improving docs, improving code, improve operations, create services in an open environment!

## Meta Information

The way how we organise our community and work is heavily inspired by the [Kubernetes Community]!

## Governance

Open Services Group has the following types of groups that are officially supported:

* **[Steering Committee](/committee-steering/README.md)** are named people that are chartered to take on sensitive topics.
  This group is encouraged to be as open as possible while achieving its mission but, because of the nature of the topics discussed, private communications are allowed.
* **[Special Interest Groups (SIGs)](/sig-list.md)** are persistent open groups that focus on a part of the project.
  SIGs must have open and transparent proceedings.
  Anyone is welcome to participate and contribute provided they follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
  The purpose of a SIG is to own and develop a set of **[Subprojects](/sub-projects.md)**.
  * **[Subprojects](/sub-projects.md)**: Each SIG can have a set of subprojects.
    These are smaller groups that can work independently.
* **[Working Groups](/working-groups.md)** are temporary groups that are formed to address issues that cross SIG boundaries.
  Working groups do not own any code or other long term artifacts.
  Working groups can report back and act through involved SIGs.

See the [full governance doc](/governance.md) for more details on these groups.

A SIG can have its own policy for contribution, described in a `README` or `CONTRIBUTING` file in the [SIG folder](/sig/) in this repo, and its own communication channels.

## Contribute

A first step to contributing is to pick from the [list of SIGs](/sig/README.md).
Start attending SIG meetings, join the communication channel or/and subscribe to the mailing list.
SIGs will often have a set of "help wanted" issues that can help new contributors get involved.

The [Contributor Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) provides detailed instruction on how to get your ideas and bug fixes seen and accepted, including:

1. How to [file an issue]
2. How to [find something to work on]
3. How to [open a pull request]

## Membership

We encourage all contributors to become members. We aim to grow an active, healthy community of contributors, reviewers, and code owners.
